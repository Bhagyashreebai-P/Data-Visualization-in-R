# Basic Visualization

Histogram

Histogram is basically a plot that breaks the data into bins (or breaks) and shows frequency distribution of these bins.You can change the breaks also and see the effect it has data visualization in terms of understandability

Bar/ Line Chart

Line Chart

Line Charts are commonly preferred when we are to analyse a trend spread over a time period. Furthermore, line plot is also suitable to plots where we need to compare relative changes in quantities across some variable.

Bar Chart

Bar Plots are suitable for showing comparison between cumulative totals across several groups.  Stacked Plots are used for bar plots for various categories.

Box Plot

Box Plot  shows 5 statistically significant numbers- the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile and the maximum. It is thus useful for visualizing the spread of the data is and deriving inferences accordingly.

Scatter Plot

Scatter plots help in visualizing data easily and for simple data inspection


# Advanced Visualization

Hexbin Binning

We can use the hexbin package in case we have multiple points in the same place (overplotting). Hexagon binning is a form of bivariate histogram useful for visualizing the structure in datasets with large n.

Mosaic Plot

A mosaic plot can be used for plotting categorical data very effectively with the area of the data showing the relative proportions.

Heat Map

Heat maps enable you to do exploratory data analysis with two dimensions as the axis and the third dimension shown by intensity of color. However you need to convert the dataset to a matrix format.

3D Graphs

 One of the easiest ways of impressing someone by Râ€™s capabilities is by creating a 3D graph in R without writing ANY line of code and within 3 minutes. Is it too much to ask for?

 We use the package R Commander which acts as Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
 
 Here are the steps:

1.Simply install the Rcmdr package

2.Use the 3D plot option from within graphs
